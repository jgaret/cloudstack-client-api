Simple toolkit to use the cloudstack API from command line.

Still not widely tested nor documented...

To use it, you can export : 
- CS_API_KEY with the user's API key
- CS_SECRET_KEY with the user's Secret key
- CS_URL as url of the cloudstack management server (something like http://cloudctl.domain.tld:8080/client/)

Needs more testing, especially against acton release and admin commands
